# Problem

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

For this challenge, we want to you to calculate the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month. We also want to know the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border.

# Input

For this challenge, you will be given an input file, Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv, that will reside in the top-most input directory of your repository.

For the purposes of this challenge, you'll want to pay attention to the following fields:

- Border: Designates what border was crossed
- Date: Timestamp indicating month and year of crossing
- Measure: Indicates means, or type, of crossing being measured (e.g., vehicle, equipment, passenger or pedestrian)
- Value: Number of crossings
